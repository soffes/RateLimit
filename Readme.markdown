[![Version](https://img.shields.io/github/release/soffes/RateLimit.svg)](https://github.com/soffes/RateLimit/releases) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/soffes/RateLimit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/soffes/RateLimit) [![Carthage compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/Carthage-compatible-4BC51D.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) [![CocoaPods compatible](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/v/RateLimit.svg)](https://cocoapods.org/pods/RateLimit)

Simple utility for only executing code every so often.

This will only execute the block passed for a given `name` if the last time it was called is greater than `limit` or it has never been called.

This is really handy for refreshing stuff in `viewDidAppear:` but preventing it from happening a ton if it was just refreshed.

Rate Limit is **fully thread-safe.** Released under the [MIT license](LICENSE).


## Usage

``` swift
RateLimit.execute(name: "RefreshTimeline", limit: 60) {
    // Do some work that runs a maximum of once per minute
}
```

Rate Limit doesn't persist limts across application launches. For most cases, this is ideal. If you need persistence, simply replace `RateLimit` with `PersistentRateLimit` for on disk persistence. Easy as that.

Open up the included [Xcode project](RateLimit.xcodeproj) for an [example app](Example) and [tests](Tests). See the [code](RateLimit/RateLimit.swift) for full documentation.


## Installation

### Old-School

Simply add the files in the `RateLimit` directory to your project.

### CocoaPods

Add the following to your `Podfile`:
```
pod "RateLimit"
```
Then run `pod install`.
